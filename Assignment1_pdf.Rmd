# Predicting business reviews with machine learning

## TDSP Methodology

## 1. Business Understanding

**Why do we want to predict business reviews?**

This information would be useful for current and prospective business owners, who want to obtain the best possible business image in the eyes of their customers. A survey conducted in 2014, found that reviews were the second most important factor after price when considering a purchase. In fact, 95% of customers use reviews, 86% say they are essential when making a purchase and nearly one-third of those aged under 45 consult them for every single purchase . Clearly, positive reviews are crucial to businesses[^1]. Hence, our model needs interpretability since business owners seek to understand the key factors influencing positive reviews, allowing them to adjust their behaviour accordingly. Good out-of-sample predictability is also necessary, especially to prospective business owners who may use these results when considering their business plan.
